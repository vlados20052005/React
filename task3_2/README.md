Create a simple "Timer" app with following requirements:

- display current time in format min:sec, ex. 19:23
- update current time each second
- make a play/pause button to stop and resume updating the time
- play/pause button should have different styles depend on play/pause state
- display the number of component renders

Technical requirements:
- be sure to use all of these hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef
- optional: useMemo, useCallback if you find a case to apply them


* Nice to have:
- split logic into custom hooks like useTimer()
