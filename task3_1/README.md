Create a mobile gallery app:
- display a list of photos using local .json file with data (Do not fetch data from api in this task)
- you can get json example here: https://pixabay.com/api/?key=19026224-3e73fe5ba621ff9035f503b47


Requirements:
- for styling try one (or several) of these options: css/scss modules, styled-components, tailwind
- create a separate component to display a photo card
- use props to pass data to the component

Note: the mobile header on the design is just for demonstration purposes of mobile layout, you don't have to implement it. The same is applicable for all future tasks.
