Create a page with two identical forms but different form managing approaches:
- uncontrolled components
- controlled components

For both approaches it's required to use pure React with no libraries
In the future tasks you will be able to use libraries for managing forms:
- uncontrolled approach: https://react-hook-form.com
- controlled approach: https://formik.org/docs/overview
- form validation: https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup

* Optional:
- add validation to the forms
